# dragoncurve-plot
Plot a Dragon curve (fractal) using python and matplotlib

# Introduction
I was VERY interested in dragon curve since [codewars](http://www.codewars.com) introduced it. It was on this particular
[kata](http://www.codewars.com/kata/53ad7224454985e4e8000eaa).

So, I try to fiddle with python and use `matplotlib` and `numpy` to create a visualization of it.

# Requirements
- Python 2.7
- Matplotlib 1.4.2
- Numpy 1.8.2

# Note
Feel free to update/create/improve or include this in some package. I'd probably
not yet able to make one.
