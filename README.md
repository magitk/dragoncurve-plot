Plot a Dragon curve (fractal) using python and matplotlib

# Introduction
I was VERY interested in dragon curve since [codewars](http://www.codewars.com) introduced it. It was on this particular
[kata](http://www.codewars.com/kata/53ad7224454985e4e8000eaa).

So, I try to fiddle with python and use `matplotlib` and `numpy` to create a visualization of it.
